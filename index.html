                        <p>In addition to her extensive Speech and Language experience, subject matter expertise and clinical skills, her 25+ years of experience working with Speech and Language and special education in schools has given her deep knowledge of the school districts’ systems, policies, and practices regarding special education.  This includes an awareness of state and federal laws which govern children’s and parents’ rights, as well.</p>

Judith worked with parents as part of the treatment team during sessions and for follow-up work on generalization of skills.</p>
                        <p>Judith has experience working with school districts and with families. She will provide child-centered assessments during the IEE process.</p>
